## FAQ

### How does Qibla direction work?
Qibla points toward Mecca. The compass uses your device's location to calculate the precise direction.

### How are prayer times calculated?
Prayer times are calculated using the Shafi school's Asr rule, where shadow length = 1.

### Are my journals private?
Yes. All journal entries are encrypted on your device for your privacy.

### What data is stored in the cloud vs. on my device?
Only the following are stored in our database:
- Workouts
- Journals
- Weight tracking

Everything else (ToDo Lists, Masjid Tracking, Listening Time, etc.) is stored on your device. Please note: if you delete the app, this data will be lost.

### How is workout volume calculated?
Total volume is computed per exercise per workout as the sum of weight × reps across all sets (in lb-reps). Average volume is the mean of those per-workout totals for the selected exercise over your chosen date range (i.e., average volume per session, not per set).

### How is estimated 1-rep max calculated?
Estimated 1-rep max is calculated per workout from the heaviest set of that exercise using the Epley formula:

**Estimated 1RM = weight × (1 + reps/30)**

(Weights are in pounds)
